## **How It Works** From Original Creator

Convert images to WebP with responsive sizes (e.g: 1920, 1200, 600, 300) and a 150x150 thumbnail to save on File storage. The original file will be deleted unless "Preserve" is selected. The log will inform you when conversions are complete.

Apply for New Uploads:
1. Resize Mode: Select scaling is set on Width or Height.
2. Set Sizes: Add preferred sizes (up to 4). No need to add 150.
3. Set Quality: Slide for conversion levels. (Default is 80).
4. Keep Original: Original image database files are not deleted.
5. Upload: Upload within Media Library or via a widget/element.

Apply for Existing Images:
1. Repeat: Follow Steps 1 to 4 from New Uploads
2. Run All: Click to Execute the Full Sequence.

Apply Manually for Existing Images:
1. Repeat: Follow Steps 1 to 4 from New Uploads
2. Convert/Scale: Process existing images to WebP.
3. Cleanup Images: Remove non-WebP files (unless preserved).
4. Fix URLs: Update Media URLs to use WebP.

NOTE:
a) Apply No Conversion: Deactivate Snippet before uploading images.
b) Backups: Use a robust backup system before running any code/tool.
c) Processing Speed: This depends on server, number of images.
d) Log Delays: Updates appear in batches of 50.
e) Option to Stop: Click Stop to stop the process.
